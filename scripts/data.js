I am making quite limited numbers of those as the process is very, very time consuming. One in every color was made for making the photos and all the subsequent are made to order. There is extremely small chance that you would meet a person having one exactly like this, and as I am the only person making such handbags :-)\r\n\r\nIt measures 23 x 10,5 x 2 cm (outside, approx). Inside it is approximately 22 x 9,5 x 1,6 cm. The inside is covered with dark grey satin. It&#39;s big enough to fit easily all you would usually bring to a party, opera etc.. There is a small business card size pocket inside. The bricks are connected with each other, the connection is very strong but flexible, so the whole clutch is exactly as stiff as it should be, and no brick will fall off. There is absolutely no chance the handbag will fall apart, even if somebody would deliberately cut one of the strings, all the others will hold the bricks in place. The closing is made with bricks also.\r\n\r\nAll the bricks used to make it are brand new (i.e. straight out of the box, never played with and of course only original LEGO\u00ae bricks), so the clutch has this amazing shine of new bricks. It is very elegant, does not seem at all like a toy handbag.\r\n\r\nThe clutch can be made to order in many colors - white, tan, dark tan, orange, yellow, red, dark red, blue, dark blue, lime,  brown, light or dark grey, and of course in multicoolor version where every brick would be surrounded by bricks in different colors. The flap can be made in a different color than the body and of course every custom design is possible - stripes, checkered etc. Every clutch has a matching color satin liner, a custom dust protection bag with my logo, and is shipped in a securely and carefully packed box.\r\n\r\nPlease note the pre shipping time stated below. \r\nThe delivery times (3 workdays for Europe, 5 workdays for US and 10 workdays for Asia & Australia) are not guaranteed and it may happen the package will be delivered later than this. Insurance is of course possible - e-mail me for rates.","creation_tsz":1422050025,"ending_tsz":1432414425,"original_creation_tsz":1335028796,"last_modified_tsz":1422050025,"price":"180.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["lego","clutch","bag","handbag","gift","poarty","fashion","elegant","unique"],"category_path":["Bags and Purses","Clutch"],"category_path_ids":[69150455,68888642],"materials":["lego","lego bricks"],"shop_section_id":10722598,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1421986825,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/98078529\/yellow-clutch-made-entirely-of-lego?utm_source=explorer&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":7169,"num_favorers":407,"shipping_template_id":2223494561,"processing_min":20,"processing_max":30,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","is_private":false,"recipient":"women","occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":330599191,"hex_code":"FBEAA0","red":251,"green":234,"blue":160,"hue":48,"saturation":36,"brightness":98,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1335030242,"listing_id":98078529,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_75x75.330599191.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_170x135.330599191.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_570xN.330599191.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_fullxfull.330599191.jpg","full_height":800,"full_width":800},{"listing_image_id":330599193,"hex_code":"F9E7A4","red":249,"green":231,"blue":164,"hue":47,"saturation":34,"brightness":97,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1335030242,"listing_id":98078529,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_75x75.330599193.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_170x135.330599193.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_570xN.330599193.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_fullxfull.330599193.jpg","full_height":800,"full_width":800},{"listing_image_id":330735592,"hex_code":"FBE99B","red":251,"green":233,"blue":155,"hue":48,"saturation":38,"brightness":98,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1335030242,"listing_id":98078529,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_75x75.330735592.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_170x135.330735592.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_570xN.330735592.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_fullxfull.330735592.jpg","full_height":800,"full_width":800},{"listing_image_id":330735590,"hex_code":"FDF7D2","red":253,"green":247,"blue":210,"hue":51,"saturation":16,"brightness":99,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1335030242,"listing_id":98078529,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_75x75.330735590.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_170x135.330735590.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_570xN.330735590.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_fullxfull.330735590.jpg","full_height":800,"full_width":800},{"listing_image_id":330735594,"hex_code":"FCF4CC","red":252,"green":244,"blue":204,"hue":50,"saturation":19,"brightness":98,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1335030242,"listing_id":98078529,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_75x75.330735594.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_170x135.330735594.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_570xN.330735594.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/5760503\/il_fullxfull.330735594.jpg","full_height":800,"full_width":800}],"Shop":{"shop_id":5760503,"shop_name":"agabag","user_id":8975983,"creation_tsz":1262901547,"title":"agabag","announcement":"Unique handbags made with original LEGO bricks.

","policy_shipping":"Production time for soaps is approximately 3-5 business days, depending on the number of soaps ordered. Custom orders can take longer, depending on the size of the order. We generally make and ship your soap order approximately 10 days prior to your party date to ensure that the soaps are fresh and vibrant. Over time the colors in the soaps will fade and may bleed into each other.\r\n\r\nWe ship most items via USPS Priority Mail. Shipping times provided by third party shippers are estimates and we do not guarantee delivery dates. We rely on third party shippers for this information. You will be provided a tracking number so you may track your shipment. Please check your e-mail address for notification when your order ships. ","policy_refunds":"Refund Policy:\r\nDue to the nature of our personal care items, all sales are final. No refunds, exchanges, or returns. Custom orders are not refundable as they are made to customer specifications. No refunds, exchanges, or returns. We take great care in packaging your items to ensure they will arrive to your location safely and intact. If you have a concern you should request and purchase insurance for your package. If you purchase USPS insurance for your package it is your responsibility to file any and all claims for damage.\r\n\r\nCancellation Policy:\r\nOrders can be canceled at any time prior to development\/fulfillment\/shipping for a full refund. Cancellations or changes to custom orders cannot be accepted once your order has been processed. Be sure to review and verify the accuracy of your entire order. Check your spelling, dates and names carefully. Please convo The Bath of Khan for information on cancelling your order.\r\n","policy_additional":"Our products DO NOT CONTAIN: \r\nParabens, Mineral Oil, Petrolatum, Propylene Glycol, SLS, Chemicals, Additives.\r\n\r\nVegan & Cruelty Free! Not tested on animals.","policy_seller_info":"Mica, pigments, and dyes are used to color the soap, and many are bleeding\/migrating colors, meaning they will eventually move into other soap layers. Every effort will be made to use non-bleeding colors with multiple-layered soaps, however, this cannot always be done. Therefore, over time, the soap may bleed, fade, or lighten.\r\n\r\nCertain scents have been known to discolor the soap. Scents such as vanilla have a high content of brown, therefore it will discolor the soap slightly. While this is generally not noticeable, an order with multiple scents may have slight variances in color. In order to avoid this, we suggest that you choose 1 scent. \r\n\r\nGlycerin soap will attract moisture from the air. This causes a beaded effect or what is known as &quot;glycerin dew&quot; to appear on the soap. Glycerin dew is a natural soap reaction due to the high content of glycerin in the soap. It does not affect the quality or use of the soap. Simply wipe off the &quot;dew&quot; with a tissue or sponge.\r\n \r\nPlease note all effort is made to completely clean molds after the use of nut or chocolate fragrance oils. If you have allergies or sensitivities, please keep in mind that these types of fragrance oils are offered and used in these molds and I can no longer guarantee the molds are allergen-free. Please contact me if you have any questions about this.\r\n\r\nThe Bath of Khan is a proud member of the HANDCRAFTED SOAP AND COSMETIC GUILD.\r\n\r\nOur soap is not affiliated with any company or legal entity, but was made from officially-licensed molds legally acquired from licensed distributors.
